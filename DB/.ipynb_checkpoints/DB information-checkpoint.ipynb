       "  'This study examines whether the influence of family ownership on R&D investment varies depending on growth opportunities and business group membership. Using data on Korean firms over ten years (1998-2007), the study shows that family ownership is negatively related to R&D investment, but the relationship becomes positive when growth opportunities are present. The moderating effect, however, differs between independent family firms and family business groups. The positive influence that growth opportunities have on promoting R&D investment is diminished for affiliates of family business groups. These findings imply that family owners invest more in R&D when their family control goals are threatened by the loss of growth potential. The empirical results of this study and its behavioral decision-making model help to bridge the gap between the predictions of the family control perspective and agency theory in explaining R&D investment by family firms in an emerging economy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',\n",

This study examines the decisions of entrepreneurs to begin exploiting business opportunities from a resource-based view.

Moreover, the findings of this study shed a light on a less empha- sized aspect of the resource-based view: the new product's anticipated lead time acts as an enhancing moderator in entrepreneurs' exploitation decision policies.

       "  'This study investigates how firm age and environmental adversity influence exploration and exploitation and whether the balance between them increases new product development. We also examine if new product development in new and mature firms leads to equivalent growth rates. Empirical results obtained from a survey of small- and medium-sized technology-based manufacturing firms in Korea show that while relative exploration generally remains lower in mature firms than in new firms, it more rapidly increases in mature firms when they operate in adverse environments. Interestingly, our results show that mature firms achieve lower growth rates through new product development than new firms in adverse environments. These empirical findings advance our understanding of the age-dependent antecedents and consequences of new product development. © 1988-2012 IEEE.',\n",
       "  \"Emerging market firms (EMFs) are increasingly relying on innovation to find their competitive advantage, but our understanding of how institutional change affects firm innovation has been limited. We analyzed Korean manufacturing firms from 1994 to 2006 to test the proposition that market-oriented institutional change in an emerging economy alleviates firms' financing constraints and monitoring problems and improves the effectiveness of their innovation activities. Institutional evolution in the economy was found to affect Korean business groups and independent firms differently. Institutional change reduced the financing constraints on independent firms more than for business group affiliates in R&D investment. Independent firms, however, appeared less capable than group affiliates of translating the benefits of improved institutional environments into efficient R&D investment. This asymmetry may lead to a wider gap in the efficiency of R&D investment between business group affiliates and independent firms. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\",\n",
       "  \"Existing governance theories offer contrasting views on the potential effect that controlling owners have on a firm's innovation investment decisions: the stewardship perspective suggests a positive influence, whereas the principal-principal (PP) conflict perspective posits a negative influence. In this study, we attempt to reconcile these views. We propose that business group affiliation determines the extent to which the interests of controlling owners and affiliated firms are congruent, and may motivate controlling owners to behave opportunistically. Our analysis of Korean companies shows that controlling owners of independent firms significantly promote R&D investments, particularly when growth opportunities are plentiful. However, the relationship becomes much weaker for business group affiliates. © 2012 IEEE.\",\n",

       "  'This study attempts to reveal how macroeconomic and technology policies that encompass the opportunity and individual drivers of entrepreneurship explain the dynamics of new firm formation in a country. To do so we rely on the Schumpeterian, industrial organization, and labor economics traditions of entrepreneurship, and performed an exploratory test with longitudinal U.S. data from 1968 to 1993. The results of this study suggest that R&D investments, patents, economic concentration, pro-competition policy, and labor mobility are important areas in which government policy can influence the intensity of new firm formation. © Springer 2006.',\n",
       "  \"Using verbal protocol and conjoint analyses, this study examines how stakeholders assess an organization in deciding whether to provide their support to it. The authors find that stakeholders' support depends on their perceptions of an organization's age and other dimensions of newness related to addressing management challenges of adaptation - the entrepreneurial problem, the engineering problem, and the administrative problem. Stakeholder support is more likely for those organizations that are old, cognitively legitimate, affectively congruent, reliable, accountable, and strategically flexible.

       "  'YOUNGBAE KIM IS AN ASSISTANT professor of management and policy in the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea and Youngrok Choi is a researcher in the nuclear policy division of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Taejon, Korea. This study attempts to identify the patterns of strategic behaviour of small firms in Korea in conjunction with their performance. Based on the data from 79 small firms across four industries, the results reveal that there appear to be four common strategic attributes cost efficiency, innovative differentiation, marketing differentiation, and asset parsimony and five strategic types of firms which have distinct combinations of these strategic attributes innovative, versatile, marginal, and reactive types. Each type of firm was also found to have different organisational characteristics and performance level. Finally, this study discusses the comparative management issue in the field of strategic management and offers some practical implications for managers of small firms. © 1994, Sage Publications.

       " 'Abstract': [\"Entrepreneurs' decisions to exploit opportunities\",\n",
       "  'This study examines whether the influence of family ownership on R&D investment varies depending on growth opportunities and business group membership. Using data on Korean firms over ten years (1998-2007), the study shows that family ownership is negatively related to R&D investment, but the relationship becomes positive when growth opportunities are present. The moderating effect, however, differs between independent family firms and family business groups. The positive influence that growth opportunities have on promoting R&D investment is diminished for affiliates of family business groups. These findings imply that family owners invest more in R&D when their family control goals are threatened by the loss of growth potential. The empirical results of this study and its behavioral decision-making model help to bridge the gap between the predictions of the family control perspective and agency theory in explaining R&D investment by family firms in an emerging economy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',\n",
       "  \"Opportunity exploitation is a necessary step in creating a successful business in the en- trepreneurial process, yet there has been little conceptual and empirical development of this issue in the literature. This study examines the decisions of entrepreneurs to begin exploiting business opportunities from a resource-based view. Our analysis of a sample of entrepreneurs whose businesses are located in incubators suggests that entrepreneurs are more likely to exploit opportunities when they perceive more knowledge of customer demand for the new product, more fully developed necessary technologies, greater managerial capability, and greater stakeholder support. Moreover, the findings of this study shed a light on a less empha- sized aspect of the resource-based view: the new product's anticipated lead time acts as an enhancing moderator in entrepreneurs' exploitation decision policies. Implications for future research on opportunity exploitation are discussed. © Dean A. Shepherd 2014. All rights reserved.\",\n",
       "  'We theorize on the performance implications of the timing at which entrepreneurs stop exploring their business opportunities and start exploiting them. Using an optimal-stopping approach, wc characterize the time when exploitation should begin based primarily on when an entrepreneur\\'s ignorance has been sufficiently reduced through knowledge accumulation. This \"ignorance threshold\" captures a tradeoff between the time needed to increase legitimacy and the necessity to act now to minimize competition. Changes in legitimacy and competition arc based on how entrepreneurs manage their knowledge (tacit versus explicit) under differing degrees of novelty for the business opportunity. These changes, in turn, impact the performance and timing of opportunity exploitation. © Dean A. Shepherd 2014. All rights reserved.',\n",
       "  'This study investigates how firm age and environmental adversity influence exploration and exploitation and whether the balance between them increases new product development. We also examine if new product development in new and mature firms leads to equivalent growth rates. Empirical results obtained from a survey of small- and medium-sized technology-based manufacturing firms in Korea show that while relative exploration generally remains lower in mature firms than in new firms, it more rapidly increases in mature firms when they operate in adverse environments. Interestingly, our results show that mature firms achieve lower growth rates through new product development than new firms in adverse environments. These empirical findings advance our understanding of the age-dependent antecedents and consequences of new product development. © 1988-2012 IEEE.',\n",
       "  \"Emerging market firms (EMFs) are increasingly relying on innovation to find their competitive advantage, but our understanding of how institutional change affects firm innovation has been limited. We analyzed Korean manufacturing firms from 1994 to 2006 to test the proposition that market-oriented institutional change in an emerging economy alleviates firms' financing constraints and monitoring problems and improves the effectiveness of their innovation activities. Institutional evolution in the economy was found to affect Korean business groups and independent firms differently.

This study attempts to identify the patterns of strategic behaviour of small firms in Korea in conjunction with their performance. Based on the data from 79 small firms across four industries, the results reveal that there appear to be four common strategic attributes cost efficiency, innovative differentiation, marketing differentiation, and asset parsimony and five strategic types of firms which have distinct combinations of these strategic attributes innovative, versatile, marginal, and reactive types. Each type of firm was also found to have different organisational characteristics and performance level.

       "  'This study examines whether the influence of family ownership on R&D investment varies depending on growth opportunities and business group membership. Using data on Korean firms over ten years (1998-2007), the study shows that family ownership is negatively related to R&D investment, but the relationship becomes positive when growth opportunities are present. The moderating effect, however, differs between independent family firms and family business groups. The positive influence that growth opportunities have on promoting R&D investment is diminished for affiliates of family business groups. These findings imply that family owners invest more in R&D when their family control goals are threatened by the loss of growth potential. The empirical results of this study and its behavioral decision-making model help to bridge the gap between the predictions of the family control perspective and agency theory in explaining R&D investment by family firms in an emerging economy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',\n",

This study examines the decisions of entrepreneurs to begin exploiting business opportunities from a resource-based view. Our analysis of a sample of entrepreneurs whose businesses are located in incubators suggests that entrepreneurs are more likely to exploit opportunities when they perceive more knowledge of customer demand for the new product, more fully developed necessary technologies, greater managerial capability, and greater stakeholder support. Moreover, the findings of this study shed a light on a less emphasized aspect of the resource-based view: the new product's anticipated lead time acts as an enhancing moderator in entrepreneurs' exploitation decision policies.

This study attempts to identify the patterns of strategic behaviour of small firms in Korea in conjunction with their performance. Based on the data from 79 small firms across four industries, the results reveal that there appear to be four common strategic attributes cost efficiency, innovative differentiation, marketing differentiation, and asset parsimony and five strategic types of firms which have distinct combinations of these strategic attributes innovative, versatile, marginal, and reactive types. Each type of firm was also found to have different organisational characteristics and performance level. Finally, this study discusses the comparative management issue in the field of strategic management and offers some practical implications for managers of small firms. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Using data on Korean firms over ten years (1998-2007), the study shows that family ownership is negatively related to R&D investment, but the relationship becomes positive when growth opportunities are present. The moderating effect, however, differs between independent family firms and family business groups. The positive influence that growth opportunities have on promoting R&D investment is diminished for affiliates of family business groups. These findings imply that family owners invest more in R&D when their family control goals are threatened by the loss of growth potential. The empirical results of this study and its behavioral decision-making model help to bridge the gap between the predictions of the family control perspective and agency theory in explaining R&D investment by family firms in an emerging economy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We theorize on the performance implications of the timing at which entrepreneurs stop exploring their business opportunities and start exploiting them. Using an optimal-stopping approach, wc characterize the time when exploitation should begin based primarily on when an entrepreneur\\'s ignorance has been sufficiently reduced through knowledge accumulation. This \"ignorance threshold\" captures a tradeoff between the time needed to increase legitimacy and the necessity to act now to minimize competition. Changes in legitimacy and competition arc based on how entrepreneurs manage their knowledge (tacit versus explicit) under differing degrees of novelty for the business opportunity. These changes, in turn, impact the performance and timing of opportunity exploitation. © Dean A. Shepherd 2014. All rights reserved. Ignorance reduction; Knowledge management; Opportunity exploitation; Optimal stopping; Timing of exploitation Exploration, exploitation, and growth through new product development: The moderating effects of firm age and environmental adversity This study investigates how firm age and environmental adversity influence exploration and exploitation and whether the balance between them increases new product development. We also examine if new product development in new and mature firms leads to equivalent growth rates. Empirical results obtained from a survey of small- and medium-sized technology-based manufacturing firms in Korea show that while relative exploration generally remains lower in mature firms than in new firms, it more rapidly increases in mature firms when they operate in adverse environments. Interestingly, our results show that mature firms achieve lower growth rates through new product development than new firms in adverse environments. These empirical findings advance our understanding of the age-dependent antecedents and consequences of new product development. © 1988-2012 IEEE. Adverse environments; exploitation; exploration; firm age; firm growth; new product development Market-oriented institutional change and R&D investments: Do business groups enhance advantage? Emerging market firms (EMFs) are increasingly relying on innovation to find their competitive advantage, but our understanding of how institutional change affects firm innovation has been limited. We analyzed Korean manufacturing firms from 1994 to 2006 to test the proposition that market-oriented institutional change in an emerging economy alleviates firms\\' financing constraints and monitoring problems and improves the effectiveness of their innovation activities. Institutional evolution in the economy was found to affect Korean business groups and independent firms differently. Institutional change reduced the financing constraints on independent firms more than for business group affiliates in R&D investment. Independent firms, however, appeared less capable than group affiliates of translating the benefits of improved institutional environments into efficient R&D investment. This asymmetry may lead to a wider gap in the efficiency of R&D investment between business group affiliates and independent firms. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. Business groups; Financing constraints; Governance reforms; Institutional change; Research and development Ownership structure, business group affiliation and R&D investments Existing governance theories offer contrasting views on the potential effect that controlling owners have on a firm\\'s innovation investment decisions: the stewardship perspective suggests a positive influence, whereas the principal-principal (PP) conflict perspective posits a negative influence. In this study, we attempt to reconcile these views. We propose that business group affiliation determines the extent to which the interests of controlling owners and affiliated firms are congruent, and may motivate controlling owners to behave opportunistically. Our analysis of Korean companies shows that controlling owners of independent firms significantly promote R&D investments, particularly when growth opportunities are plentiful. However, the relationship becomes much weaker for business group affiliates. © 2012 IEEE. business group; controlling ownership; R&D investments When should entrepreneurs expedite or delay opportunity exploitation?

To do so we rely on the Schumpeterian, industrial organization, and labor economics traditions of entrepreneurship, and performed an exploratory test with longitudinal U.S. data from 1968 to 1993. The results of this study suggest that R&D investments, patents, economic concentration, pro-competition policy, and labor mobility are important areas in which government policy can influence the intensity of new firm formation. © Springer 2006. Entrepreneurial policy; Government; New firm formation Stakeholder perceptions of age and other dimensions of newness Using verbal protocol and conjoint analyses, this study examines how stakeholders assess an organization in deciding whether to provide their support to it. The authors find that stakeholders\\' support depends on their perceptions of an organization\\'s age and other dimensions of newness related to addressing management challenges of adaptation - the entrepreneurial problem, the engineering problem, and the administrative problem. Stakeholder support is more likely for those organizations that are old, cognitively legitimate, affectively congruent, reliable, accountable, and strategically flexible.
